## Notes
Some challenges that I faced while building my app was that I was having issues with my computer for it's a little old and it freezes quite often.  I tried using school computers but because the software in my computer is not the same as the school computer I had software compatibility issues.  I didn't implement the optional features for these problems, but I plan on doing my best for this course.
