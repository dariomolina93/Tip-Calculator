## Notes
Some challenges that I faced while building my app was that I was having issues with my computer for it's a little old and it freezes quite often.  I tried using school computers but because the software in my computer is not the same as the school computer I had software compatibility issues.  I submitted my work yesterday and obtained feedback to improve UI. I've been working for quite some time on the app and I am far more pleased how to the app looks and behaves.
